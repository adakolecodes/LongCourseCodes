# VUE JS

**What is Vue Js?**

Vue is a frontend JavaScript framework for building websites, webapps and user interfaces

There are two major ways we can build a project using vue. First is by building the project using vue CDN (majorly for prototyping and learning purpose) and secondly by building the project using vue CLI (for development purpose)

# Setting up vue js on windows & creating project

1. Ensure Node.js is installed on PC. Download from https://nodejs.org/en/ 
2. Install vue js globally on your pc by running: `npm install -g @vue/cli` on your command prompt
3. Create project by running: `vue create nameofproject` in command prompt
4. Select vue version (vue 3)
5. Navigate into the project folder by running: `cd nameofproject`
6. Run the project on a local host by running: `npm run serve`

Your vue project should now be started on a local host, press ctrl and click on link or copy the link and open in browser

(To exit out of the connection, enter ctrl+c)

(To create new project next time, simply run `vue create nameofproject` in your terminal)
