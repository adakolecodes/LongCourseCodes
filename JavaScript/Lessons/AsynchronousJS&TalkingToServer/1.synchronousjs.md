# WHAT IS SYNCHRONOUS JAVASCRIPT?

Synchronous JavaScript is like doing tasks one after another and waiting for each task to finish before starting the next. It's like following a specific order of steps to complete a series of tasks.

Let's see a practical example

Imagine you have a recipe for making a sandwich, and you want to follow the recipe step by step. Each step is important and needs to be completed before moving on to the next. That's like synchronous JavaScript.

Here's an example of making a sandwich using synchronous JavaScript:

```javascript
console.log("Step 1: Take two slices of bread.");
console.log("Step 2: Spread butter on one side of each bread slice.");
console.log("Step 3: Place a slice of cheese on one bread slice.");
console.log("Step 4: Place a slice of ham on top of the cheese.");
console.log("Step 5: Put the other bread slice (buttered side down) on top of the ham.");
console.log("Step 6: Your sandwich is ready to eat!");
```

In synchronous JavaScript, you follow the recipe step by step and wait for each step to be completed before moving on to the next. It's like following a specific order of instructions to make a sandwich.

To summarize:

- Synchronous JavaScript is like following a recipe step by step, completing each step before moving on to the next.
- It's like following a specific order of instructions to complete a task, just like making a sandwich using a recipe.
