**WHAT IS ASYNCHRONOUS JAVASCRIPT?**

Asynchronous JavaScript is like doing tasks and other activities at the same time, switching back and forth without waiting for each task to finish.

Let's look at a practical example

Imagine you have different tasks to do, like playing with blocks, coloring a picture, and eating a snack. Instead of doing them one after another and waiting for each task to finish, you can do them at the same time and switch between tasks when needed. That's like asynchronous JavaScript.

For example, let's say you have the following tasks:

1. Play with blocks (takes 5 seconds).
2. Color a picture (takes 3 seconds).
3. Eat a snack (takes 2 seconds).

In asynchronous JavaScript, you can start each task and switch between them while waiting for the tasks to finish. It's like having multiple things happening at the same time.

Here's an example of asynchronous JavaScript using setTimeout() to simulate delays:

```javascript
console.log("Playing with blocks...");
setTimeout(function() {
    console.log("Blocks playtime is over!");
}, 5000);


console.log("Coloring a picture...");
setTimeout(function() {
    console.log("Picture coloring is done!");
}, 3000);


console.log("Eating a snack...");
setTimeout(function() {
    console.log("Snack time is over!");
}, 2000);
```

In this example, each task starts but doesn't wait for the previous task to finish. So you can play with blocks, color a picture, and eat a snack simultaneously.

The output will be something like:

Playing with blocks...
Coloring a picture...
Eating a snack...
Snack time is over!
Picture coloring is done!
Blocks playtime is over!
