## # Code Assistance & Debugging

**1. Introduction to Debugging & Code Assistance**

* Understanding what debugging is
* Debugging as a crucial part of web development
* Issues Developers run into - syntax errors, logical mistakes, unfamiliar error messages
* Tools for debugging and code assistance - ChatGPT, Grok

**2. How to Use Grok for Debugging (Live Demonstration)**
* Demonstrating how AI can identify a bug/issue in a code, explain the issue and fix it
-- Debug my code
-- Explain the error to AI

**3. Hands-on Exercise**

## # Learning

**1. How AI Helps in Learning Concepts**

Live Demo: How AI can simplify explanations of coding concepts.

For example: "`What’s the difference between var, let, and const in JavaScript? Explain in a very simple and easy to understand manner`"

**2. Best Practices for Using AI for Learning**
* **Be Specific**: Instead of "Explain JavaScript" ask "`Explain JavaScript async/await with an example.`"
* **Ask for Examples**: Always ask AI for examples to a concept it explains. For example "`Explain JavaScript async/await with an example.`"
* **Break Down Complex Topics in an easy-to-understand way**: Ask, “`Can you explain this in steps and in a very simple, easy to understand manner?`” then provide code below.

**3. Hands-on Exercises**

**Onclick** Event in JavaScript

Use AI to:
* Get a beginner-friendly explanation
* Generate a code example
* Present your findings to the class

## # Generating Code Snippets

**1. How AI Can Generate Code Snippets**

Live Demo: How to generate code snippet

* **Requesting a Basic Code Snippet**
For example: "`Generate a simple JavaScript function to validate an email address.`"

* **Customizing/modifying the Code Snippet**
"`Modify the email validation function to check for a minimum length of 6 characters.`"

* **Requesting Snippets for Different Technologies**
HTML & CSS Example:
"`Generate a responsive navigation bar using HTML and CSS.`"

**2. Best Practices for Using ChatGPT for Code Generation**
* **Be Specific**: Instead of "`Generate a login form,`" ask "`Generate a modern registration form with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript validation.`"
* **Request Explanations**: Ask, “`Explain how this code works step by step.`”
* **Modify & Test the Code**: Always review AI-generated code and adapt it to your project.
* **Ask for Alternative Approaches**: Request multiple solutions to compare efficiency.

**3. Hands-on Exercises**

Use AI to generate the following JavaScrip function 
* Word Counter: A JavaScript function that counts the number of words in a given sentence
* Odd or Even Checker: A JavaScript function that checks whether a number is odd or even
* Ask AI to explain the generated code in simple term
* Present your findings to the class
